			<h4> 
			- What? 
			</h4>
			<p>
			Speak Up is an app for girls and women where they can look at each Party in Parliments Policies and get a better understaning of what they are.

			It is a platform where women can also see where others are using the app and creates the oppourtunity for them to chat and potentially meet in person to discuss their opinions and views on the matters at hand.

			Speak Up creates a place for girls and women to learn, discuss, and group together to take action against issues that effect them.  
			</p>

		

			<h4> 
			- Why? 
			</h4>
			<p>
			The inspiration for Speak Up was to create a modern version of Womens sufferage. A way for women who are all fighting for the same change to happen to come together on a social platform instead of going door to door to gain support.
			</p>

			

			<h4> 
			- Who? 
			</h4>
			<p>
			Speak Up was created for women and girls to use whether they are involoved, interested, or know nothing about politics within New Zealand and want to make their voices heard.
